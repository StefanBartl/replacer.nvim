---@module 'replacer.perfile'
--- Per-file confirmation step for ALL-mode applies (--confirm-per-file):
--- instead of one global "apply ALL N spots across M files?" confirm, ask
--- All/Skip/Only-some/Quit for each file in turn.
---
--- Uses ui.kit.confirm, which is async/callback-based (no blocking
--- return value like the native vim.fn.confirm this replaces). The file loop
--- is therefore callback-recursive: each file's confirm only advances to the
--- next one from inside its own on_answer callback, and the final totals are
--- delivered via `on_done` instead of a synchronous return. "Only some"
--- hands the file to a picker and waits for that picker session to end
--- before it asks about the next file, so no confirm float ever opens over
--- the still-open picker -- see the "Only some" branch below.
